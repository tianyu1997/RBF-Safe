# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The project follows Semantic
Versioning for library releases and versions its on-disk schemas separately.

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- C++ and Python `TrajectoryAuditor` APIs with deterministic continuous
  line-segment coverage against certified Atlas regions.
- `CERTIFIED`, `PARTIAL`, and `INVALID` reports with parameter-space coverage,
  region sequences, explicit uncovered intervals, resource budgets, and
  cooperative cancellation.
- `rbfsafe-inspect --trajectory` support for JSON waypoint arrays.

### Changed

- CI uses explicit Release configurations for single- and multi-config CMake
  generators and current Node 24 GitHub actions.

- C++20 geometry, LECT, Atlas, and aggregate CMake targets.
- Serial DH robot and AABB scene models with deterministic SHA-256 identity.
- IFK-AA + LinkIAABB conservative regional certification.
- Deterministic seed-guided Atlas construction, merging, adjacency, and
  connected-component queries.
- Public mutable LECT and immutable snapshot APIs with stable path keys.
- Checksummed little-endian Atlas schema v1 with atomic publication.
- High-level `rbfsafe` Python bindings, specific exception types, CLI, and
